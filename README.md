# Smooth Sailing: A seaborn primer using open health data

### Overview
Quick-start, low-code methods for visualizing open health data. 

This workshop walks through the lifecycle of retrieving, filtering, and visualizing a dataset with seaborn, a Python library. It's aimed at anyone who wants to quickly get up and running with data analysis and exploration, and is meant to be approachable for most levels.
