# Smooth Sailing: A seaborn primer using open health data

Quick-start, low-code methods for visualizing open health data. 

This workshop walks through the lifecycle of retrieving, filtering, and visualizing a dataset with seaborn, a Python library. It's aimed at anyone who wants to quickly get up and running with data analysis and exploration, and is meant to be approachable for most levels.

Access the Jupyter notebooks used for coding in the session now: blank notebook for following along with the demo, and completed notebook for review (and comparing your code to finished, working code).
