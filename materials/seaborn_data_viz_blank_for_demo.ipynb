    "# Visualizing COVID-19 Hospital Dataset with Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-Work:**\n",
    "1. Ensure that Jupyter Notebook, Python 3, and seaborn (which will also install dependency libraries if not already installed) are installed. (See resources below for installation instructions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Using Python, import main visualization library, `seaborn`, and its dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.\n",
    "2. Define dataset and read in data using pandas function, `read_json()`. [Notes: a) we're reading in data as an API endpoint; for more about this, see associated workshop slides or resources at bottom of notebook. b) If, instead, you prefer to use your own data, see comment with alternative for `read_csv()` function.]\n",
    "3. Check data has been read is as expected using `head()` function.\n",
    "4. Graph two variables with `seaborn`as a lineplot using the `lineplot()` function.\n",
    "5. Graph these same variables, plus a third, from the source dataset with `seaborn` as a scatterplot using the `relplot()` function.\n",
    "6. See additional methods, using filtered data and other graphs. Feel free to add new cells (or open a new notebook), and try out your own ideas, using different variables or charts.\n",
    "7. When ready, save figure using `matplotlib`'s `savefig`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
